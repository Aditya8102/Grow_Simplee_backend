Grow Simplee Vehicle Routing Challenge

## Route Predictor Script
Our script contains 3 main functions, namely: 
1. Delivery Function: For generating initial delivery routes. It works on Capacitated Vehicle Routing  Problem With Time Window, in which the route starts from a common depot location and then ends at the same location giving an optimized path for each rider. 
2. Pickup Function: This function works only for the initial list of pickup locations. It works similar to the CVRPTW but with miltiple start locations and a common end location. 
3. Second Pickup Function : This funciton is similar to the pickup function. It is used for the list of pickups after the initial pickup list.

## Assumptions While Creating The Script
1. HUB is assumed to be the default address of all the delivery agents in the banaglore_dispatch _addresses.CSV file. 
2. Capacity of the riders's vehicle is based on the minimum bag creation method. 
3. "DEMAND" is referred to as the volumetric size of each location requirement. 
DEMANDS for delivery and pickup route locations is gneerated using the normal distribution curve in the range of (9cm^3, 64000cm^3), go give an unbaised result. 

4. The max bag capcity for the devliery agents is taken to be 6400000cm^3 (as mentioned by the company beforehand)

5. The time slot for each delivery agent is taken to be 6 hours.
